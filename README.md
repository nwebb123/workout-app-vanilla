## Purpose:
Application to practice Front-end skills and encourage me to exercise more often. Application consists of a Navbar, Hero section, an About section, and a Generate Workout section. Primary purpose of this web application is to generate a PPL workout routine for a given PPL training session. Future features will include a TTE calculator section and the ability to save generated workouts.  

The Generate Workout section contains an accordion and each accordion item is labeled after PPL (Push, Pull, and Legs). Each accordion item expands to provide a description of the muscle groups that the given item targets and a button labeled "Generate {Item} Workout". If the user clicks the button, a table will expand that contains various exercises that are meant to be performed on the given training day. Each time the user clicks the button to expand the table the exercises will be randomized. The exercises are provided from a data source containing each exercise as an object in an array.
